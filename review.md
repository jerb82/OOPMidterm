###  Software Design
Software Design - Definition, the two types of design (so far), where they come from, what they are concerned with

**There are many definitions**
* The process of defining software methods, functions, objects, and overall structure and interaction of your code so that the resulting functionality will satisfy user requirements.

**Two layers of design**
#### *Structured design*
- From structured programming

#### *Object-oriented design*
- From object-oriented programming

### Software Design Characteristics
- Might need to know stuff about each..? I hope not

* Compatibility
* Fault-tolerance
* Reliability
* Usability
* Performance
* Scalability
* Robustness
* Extensibility
* Modularity
* Maintainability
* Reusability
* Security

### Coding Style
- Given a function declaration or definition, imporve the code using the principles we discussed in class. Proper parameter passing

- Code is the only documentation of the design often times  

**Essential Parts of Coding Style:**
- Indentation: "flow of control"
- Newlines
- Whitespace
- Comments
- Naming conventions

**Characteristics of a Coding Style**
- Consistency
- Scability
- Maintainability
